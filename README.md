The project hierarchy was created using angular-seed. Go to https://github.com/angular/angular-seed for a detailed documentation.

### Installation

`npm` and `bower` are used to install all dependencies to the project directory.
`npm` is configured to automatically run `bower` so simply run:

```
npm install
```

### Run the Application

To run the app on an actual phone or the simulator use `Firefox`&#8217;es WebIDE and navigate to the `app` folder.

For debugging you can serve the app to localhost with:

```
npm start
```

Now browse to the app at `http://localhost:8000/app/index.html`.

```
npm run test-single-run
```

### End to end testing

```
npm start
```

then

```
npm run update-webdriver
